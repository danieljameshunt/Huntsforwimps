  <h1 id="so-what-is-dark-matter">So what is dark matter?</h1>
<p>Honestly, your guess is as good as ours, more or less. To paraphrase the Simpsons, &lsquo;Matter&rsquo; means mass and &lsquo;Dark&rsquo; means dark (does not emit light). Any more detail than that? Answers on a postcard, please.</p>
<h1 id="hang-on-so-how-do-we-know-this-is-even-real">Hang on, so how do we know this is even <em>real</em>?</h1>
<p>So we know dark matter has mass. How do we see things with mass but not light? One way is to look at how it influences matter around it. This was how we first found evidence of dark matter - Vera Rubin and Kent Ford&rsquo;s measurements of the rotation of galaxies, which is proportional to the mass in a galaxy. Measurements of this suggested not only a diffuse and inconsistent distribution of mass in galaxies, but that this mass was 5x what was expected from light emissions nearby!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example plot, made in galrotpy, fitted to data from M33. The baryonic matter in the galaxy (thin disk and local bulge) only explain a fraction of the velocity of the galaxy - the rest requires a halo of non luminous matter, following the well-modelled Nevarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-surely-we-could-just-be-wrong-about-gravity">So what? Surely we could just be wrong about gravity?</h1>
<p>Ah, but this isn&rsquo;t just an issue with scale factors, but with lack of self interaction! Here&rsquo;s another smoking gun, from the Bullet Cluster. Two galaxies are merging, leading to a huge emission of X-Rays picked up by the Chandra observatory, in pink. The mass of the cluster, in green, is measured from gravitational lensing, where an image is distorted by mass between you and the light. Not only is this mass higher than the visible light would incidate, it also still takes the shape of two clumps - indicating the mass in the two galaxies did not interact as they passed through each other. Very strange for baryonic matter, very normal for a non-luminous matter!</p>

<h1 id="okay-im-playing-devils-advocate-now-give-me-even-more-evidence">Okay, I&rsquo;m playing devil&rsquo;s advocate now. Give me even more evidence!</h1>
<p>Okay, fine. How about the CMB? We see microwaves from the beginning of the universe, travelling from all directions. But the intensity and energy of the microwaves isn&rsquo;t smooth, but lumpy. The inhomogenaity of these microwaves can tell us about the beginning of the universe - large lumps tell us about galaxies, which gives us information about gravity, while smaller lumps tell us about quantum effects like bose-einstein condensates, with properties unique to baryonic matter. Fold these together, and you can get very accurate measurements of the non-luminous matter in the universe.</p>
<p>And this plot from Planck 2018 shows that! It&rsquo;s complicated.</p>
<p><img src="images/Planck-2018-Cosmological-Parameters-Oscillations-1.png" alt="CMB"></p>
<h1 id="fine-fine-you-can-stop-now-but-why-is-there-more-dark-matter">Fine, fine, you can stop now. But why is there more dark matter?</h1>
<p>Ask too many questions about this kind of subject and you&rsquo;d be better off with a philosopher, or a priest. But we have our suspicions. If we assume dark matter existed at the beginning of everything and cooled down with the rest of the universe, then it&rsquo;s subject to the same equilibrium equations as the universe cools down and expands.</p>
<p>Imagine this: the universe cools, so the amount of energy to produce stuff goes down. So the stuff you have annihilates, and you have less stuff. But at the same time, the space you&rsquo;re in is expanding, lowering the odds of annihilation. So eventually, you reach another equilibrium position - the stuff &lsquo;freezes out&rsquo; of this process.</p>
<p>Follow the numbers on this, and you end up with a plot like the one below. Comparing this with the known dark matter density in the modern day, and we&rsquo;d be expecting a dark matter candidate around the mass of a proton - which is also around the mass we&rsquo;d expect a lot of additions to the standard model to be! We call this &rsquo;the WIMP miracle&rsquo;.</p>
<p><img src="images/WIMP-Freezeout.png" alt="FreezeOut"></p>
<h1 id="so-its-a-wimp-right-can-we-go-home-now">So it&rsquo;s a WIMP, right? Can we go home now?</h1>
<p>Well, no, not quite. These assumptions motivate the WIMP hypothesis, but there&rsquo;s a lot of &lsquo;if&rsquo;s there. What if it didn&rsquo;t exist at the beginning, but &lsquo;froze in&rsquo;? What if it does self interact? What if it couples to regular matter? What if it has some kind of asymmetry we aren&rsquo;t aware of? What if it&rsquo;s more like a scalar field, like the Higgs? And so on.</p>
<p>In fact, the real landscape looks like this. All the way from 1e-21 eV up to about the mass of a mosquito, every region has a potential dark matter candidate.</p>

<h1 id="that-doesnt-look-good">That doesn&rsquo;t look good!</h1>
<p>Right? That&rsquo;s basically like saying &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;. But I did tell a white lie earlier: we do know some details about dark matter. Specifically, what it <em>isn&rsquo;t</em>, through the hard work of a swathe of physics experiments over the last 40 years.</p>
