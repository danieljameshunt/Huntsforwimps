## Who are you?

My name's Dan. I'm a Postdoc at UT Austin looking into the direct detection of dark matter, through analysis of data from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment, as well as through crystal xenon, through R&D on CrystaLiZe. Before that, I finished my masters at the University of Birmingham NA62, did some part time work on NEWS-G, and completed my DPhil at the University of Oxford on LZ.

## Where does that highway go to?

If it goes well, it'll go to the discovery of a low-mass dark matter signal in LZ, 8B CEvNS discovery to 5 sigma, the adaptation of LZ to a crystal xenon TPC by the end of the decade, and a cushy research job on XLZD operation in the UK.

## Am I right? Am I wrong?

Maybe we don't find dark matter - if we don't, we get very close to disproving the leading (and most annoying) theories on dark matter. Finally, we can put SuSy and the WIMP miracle to rest!

## What have I done?

For my DPhil, I worked on anything which could maximise the low energy sensitivity of LZ. At the start of operation, that involved modelling and removing accidental coincidence backgrounds, where small photon and electron signals in LZ are mistaken for a low-mass WIMP. Later, this became measurements of low-energy signal acceptance, as a result of our pulse classification software. After we've removed all our backgrounds and maximised signal acceptance, the next step is to forego scintillation entirely as part of an S2-Only analysis, which I've spearheaded ML work for. And after *that*, you can maximise sensitivity through the Migdal effect, which I've helped with efforts to directly measure for the first time as part of the MIGDAL collaboration.

I've also taken up a lot of your time with a very strained Talking Heads reference. Sorry for that!
