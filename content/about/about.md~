## How did I get here?

My name's Dan. I'm a researcher specialising in the direct detection of dark matter. My high school teachers always told me I asked a lot of questions: it turns out, if you ask enough, you're eventually going to have to find answers yourself.

## How do I work this?

My work is on the other webpage, actually, under 'LZ'. But otherwise I work on watching a lot of movies, swimming, brewing alcohol, gardening, and community action.

## Where is that large automobile?

I *can* drive, but try not to when I can. In the UK, I worked with ACORN, the community union, for a year: one of our key goals was to increase campaign action for a greener Britain, starting with bus nationalization.

## What is that beautiful house?

It's not that lovely. But I grew up in a house in the UK in Wickersley, Rotherham, then spent four years in Birmingham, and then four more in Oxford.

## Where does that highway go to?

Hopefully to some lucrative results! I'll describe them here when I can.

## Am I right? Am I wrong?

I can't be the judge of that. Message through the links on the home page!

## What have I done?

I've taken up a lot of your time with a very strained Talking Heads reference. Sorry for that!
