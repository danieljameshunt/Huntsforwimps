# What's next?

Well, LZ has a fair amount of life left in it, so there'll be more limits. My goal for the next couple of years is to lower our energy threshold however possible: whether that's removing accidental backgrounds and lowering our minimum accepted S1 and S2 size, improving our pulse classification software to better accept small S2s, or low-energy analyses.

# Hang on, what's that last part?

So LZ analysis so far has looked at S1-S2 events, with three photons making up an S1. But a light enough dark matter particle would produce so little energy in the TPC that the S1 might not be produced, or might end up below detection threshold. So there's searches on the horizon using what's known as the DPE effect, analysis of only S2s, and analysis of data assuming the Migdal effect. All of these combined will leave LZ sensitive to masses as low as 30MeV!

# That's interesting! But I actually meant 'what's next after LZ'

Oh, okay. Well, we've set up the XLZD consortium (I know, the name isn't great) to build a larger LXe TPC in the next decade. Hopefully it's built in the UK! We're stepping up from ~8T to ~80T, so we'll see an order of magnitude improvement, at which point we start to also become a neutrino observatory.

# Anything else up your sleeve?

Half of my time at UT is dedicated to CrystaLiZe, a crystal xenon test bed. The leading background in most experiments like LZ is radon decays (they make up almost all of our electron recoil band), and most of this gets into the detector by flowing from the outside in. But if we freeze the xenon in place, not only do we isolate the inside of the detector from the outside elements, but we can also better track the position of the decay chain! We're testing if this is feasible at 20kg, so we can trial freezing LZ's xenon once it's finished operation, so we can propose a solid xenon TPC design for XLZD. Who knows what kind of benefits we'll see for high and low energy dark matter searches?
